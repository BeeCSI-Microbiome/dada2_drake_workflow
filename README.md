# DADA2 workflow using drake

## About

The code in this repository is for a workflow for analyzing microbial community data using the `DADA2` R package. We have built a workflow with the `drake` R package, which enables the creation of reproducible workflows for automating analyses.

We were inspired by other projects such as `ampliseq` for automating QIIME2 runs, but in this case we are looking into providing an analysis tool that can be run entirely within R.
